<h2>About:</h2>
<p>A calculator app for "magic wands" and "potion brewing", for a gaming community (Arelith) from an online persistent roleplaying server set in a game called Neverwinter Nights: Enhanecd Edition.</p>
<p>The thought process behind the creation of this project aimed to fix a two decade-long inconvenience that plagued this game's community, which involved not only a lack of clear and easily accessible information from game files but also a somewhat complex calculation under the hood - an issue that directly harmed the user experience of new players such as myself.</p>

<p>With that in mind I personally reached out to the community's developers and got my hands on some useful files that aided me in the production of this app alongside intense researching across many alleyways.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://forum.nwnarelith.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5922&sid=e38be56051edd127c2ba716d2da2f229"> Sincra </a> for giving me a XML file with the game file information, which allowed me to convert it to a JSON file in order to feed my form fields.</p>
